                              <p>After playing the original version of the game - Up the River as a team,
                                my group members and I started reflecting the reasons why the game was not
                                fun and wrote in sticky notes the elements the game is lack of.</p>

                              <p>In the first iteration, I suggested keeping the original layout of the original
                                version and added currency into the game. The game will become more dynamic by
                                adding more objectives. There will also be freedom for the player to use their
                                skills and decision-making abilities, but will be counteracted by the use of
                                rewards and punishments. The game can also be more people-fun by bringing
                                collaboration between players. </p>

                          <h4>FIRST ITERATION REFLECTION</h4>
                              <div class="content-center">
                                  <p>By redesigning the game, we first thought about what was the good thing about the original
                                    game that makes it different from other games, and what did not work. Based on my reflection
                                    of the game, I realized the original version does not have enough obstacles to be challenging,
                                    so I suggested to make the game more challenging in a way to keep player engaged. We then
                                    combine our ideas and add more obstacles to it, at the same time keeping the game as simple
                                    as possible. In short, we are keep the good thing of the game, and improving the elements
                                    that did not work well. The redesign version of the game works well on engaging the players
                                    more throughout the game compared to the original one. What did not work well is that the game
                                    gets more complicated than the original one, we plan on keeping the rules as simple as possible
                                    in the future by having less element changed from the original one.</p>

                                In the second iteration, Li suggested changing the game board to a circular board for a more continuous
                                player experience. I redesigned the game elements and crafted the player pieces as well as the game board

                                  <p>The biggest change of this iteration is the layout of the game. We changed the line layout to a circle
                                    layout. It solves the problem that players always forget to move the end bar to the top after everyone’s
                                    move. The new layout of the game also got lots of positive feedback. We also make the game less complicated
                                    by changes some rules and layout of the bars.</p>

                                  <p>During the last two playtesting session, I realized if the game rules are too long, the fun of the game

                      <h3>From this project, I realized the importance of playtesting. Game designer could not only observe how people
                        learn to play their game in a way to reflect themselves, but also hear how other people think about the game.
                         By conducting playtesting session, I learned that making a good rule sheet is critical as it is the first step
                         that people learn about the game, a short and clear rule sheet could boost the interest of people. In addition,
                         a good game does not come from only one iteration, several iterations are needed to get feedback and refine
                         the game. </h3>
