                          <p>After designing the logo by illustrator, we got the feedback from the TA that we need to improve the
                            logo by reducing the detailed of it. Due to the fact that we were using the pen tool from Illustrator
                            to draw the logo based on the one we found online, which contained lots of detailed of the leaves on
                            the tree, it made our logo too complicated and hard to be memorized by the target audiences. For these
                            reasons, we refined the edges of the logo and design the final logo with less details and alternative
                            B&W logo.</p>

                          <p>Then I designed a new logo using the pen tool in Illustrator with my partner to trace the image.
                            After trying different colour harmonies, we decided to use monochromatic harmonies of pink which
                            matched the personality of the company.</p>
